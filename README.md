<h1><a href="https://github.com/YelyzavetaBen/Project1/blob/main/Chips%20(1).ipynb">Analyzing Customer Segments and Purchasing Behavior in Retail Data</a></h1>

<h2>Goal</h2>
To identify customer segments based on purchasing behavior and provide insights to the Category Manager for Chips to formulate a strategic plan for the chip category.
<br />

<h2>Description</h2>
This project involves analyzing transaction and customer data from a retail business to understand the types of customers who purchase Chips and their purchasing behavior within the region. The dataset includes information on transactions, customer demographics, and purchasing behavior. The project will focus on data cleaning, merging transaction and customer data, analyzing sales drivers, identifying customer segments, and formulating commercial recommendations.
<br />

<h2>Skills</h2>
data cleaning and preprocessing, data analysis and visualization, identification of sales drivers, customer segmentation analysis, formulation of commercial recommendations, hypothesis testing.
<br />

<h2>Technology</h2>

- <b>Python</b> 
- <b>Pandas</b>
- <b>Seaborn</b> 
- <b>Matplotlib</b>

<h2>Results</h2>
Using Python functions the analysis revealed that mainstream midage and young singles/couples are more willing to pay more per packet of chips compared to their budget and premium counterparts. This may be due to premium shoppers being more likely to buy healthy snacks, and when they buy chips, it's mainly for entertainment purposes rather than their own consumption. There are also fewer premium midage and young singles/couples buying chips compared to their mainstream counterparts.
